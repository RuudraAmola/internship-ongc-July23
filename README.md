**EPINET User Account Creation Request Authorization System**

**Abstract and Idea**

ONGC has a large amount of data stored in SQL Databases. EPINET data centre is
basically a data repository where data reports of log, well and seismic data are stored.
To access these reports any employee needs to have an account in the EPINET portal
and for that a complete request process must be completed. The employee must fill in a
form that goes through a 3-level authentication course by the Controlling Officer, the
Head of the Department and then the Database Administrator. This process is performed
at a physical level currently.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to create a prototype for the EPINET user account
creation request system which also allows authorization of the request at the 3 levels.

**Scope of the Project**

The scope of the project entails the development of a prototype for the EPINET user
account creation request system, integrating a streamlined process for authorization at
three distinct levels. The current manual process involves the submission of a form by
an employee who wishes to access data reports stored in the EPINET data centre. The
three levels of authentication involve the Controlling Officer, the Head of the
Department, and the Database Administrator.

This is just a closest prototype of the potential system which uses a local database
created using XAMPP Control panel and PHP scripts. I have used a local database as
access to the original EPINET database is not available to me.
